# Setting up the server.
To set up the Spring server fo the first time perform the following instructions:
* Install JDK version 1.8.
* Install Maven. We used "brew" package manager on the macOS:
```
    brew install maven

    You can choose the alternative methods on how to install the postgres.
* When installing the database, specify the superusername and the password
    * Default port is 5432
    * Default hostname is localhost
* When connected to the postgresql server in pgAdmin, create a new database with 'autonomousSystem' name.
    The database name must match to the name specified in 'application.properties' file of a server.
    When you choose a custom name for a database, specify it in a server configuration file.
* Specify the database username and password in 'application.properties'.

# Starting the server
To run the server for the first time perform the following steps:
* Start the server from AutonomousSystemThesis/server folder with the following command and the hibernate will generate all necessary tables for the system:

```
* Start the server broadcast with the following command:
```

```
When running the server for the second time, you do not need to perform steps for setting up the database.
